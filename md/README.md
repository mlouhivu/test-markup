Special Python interpreter intended for massively parallel HPC systems.

When using Python for parallel applications, standard Python puts
lots of pressure on the filesystem, as during import statements
several processes try to access several small files. With thousands
of processes startup time of Python application can be more than
30 minutes.

This special interpreter performs the I/O operations used by "import"
statements only by single process, and uses MPI for transmitting data to
all other process.

Short build instructions
------------------------
Use --enable-mpi flag for configure, e.g.

./configure --enable-mpi

Build and install standard Python interpreter

make
make install

Build and install the special Python interpreter

make mpi
make install-mpi

Short usage instructions
------------------------
The procedure described above creates two executables:

"python" is the standard Python interpreter, which can be used for
normal serial applications and e.g. for software installations.

"python_mpi" is the special Python interpreter which has to be started
with mpirun (or equivalent MPI launch command), e.g.

mpirun -np 16384 python_mpi my_application.py

Disabling I/O wrappers
----------------------
It is possible to disable the special I/O wrappers on-the-fly and revert to
the standard POSIX calls by using the built-in function wrapoff() in a Python
script. For example:

wrapoff()
from numpy import array

Similarly, they can be turned back on with the built-in function wrapon().

Limitations
-----------
All the process have to perform the same "import" statements, e.g. code like

if rank == 0:
    import mymodule

is NOT allowed. If you need to do it, please use the wrapoff() and wrapon()
functions to disable the special I/O wrappers temporarily.

If you experience an unexpected deadlock while using Scalable Python, it is
most likely due to triggering this limitation. Unfortunately, even some
standard modules use in-function import statements, so the root cause may turn
out to be an innocent looking function call within an if statement. If needed,
you can try to turn off the special I/O wrappers e.g. after the initial module
imports.

Other build considerations
--------------------------
By default, the MPI related parts in special interpreter are build by "mpicc".
Alternate MPI compiler can be specified with variable MPICC.
